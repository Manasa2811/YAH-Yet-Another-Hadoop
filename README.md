# YAH-Yet-Another-Hadoop

YAH (Yet Another Hadoop) is one of the project titles that can be taken up as a part of the UE19CS322 Big Data course at PES University. It is a mini-HDFS setup on your system, complete with the architectural structure consisting of Data Nodes and Name Nodes and replication of data across nodes. With this project we can create a distributed file system as per our needs. It also allows running Hadoop like jobs to break down computationally heavy tasks into smaller distributed tasks.

The main objective of this project is to get an in depth understanding of Hadoop and its architecture. We also get to edit and tweak it as per our needs and observe its inner working. At the end of this project we were able to simulate a miniature HDFS capable of performing some of the important tasks a distributed file system performs.

Language used for implementation- python
Libraries used- rpyc.utils.server, collections
